## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? an open source distributed version control system
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is the open source distributed version control system, while GitHub is used to store, track, check, and share your code.
3. Why do we create a branch? Creating a branch allows us to edit our own, or someone elses code and then merge it back to the main.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? A pull request compares two codes and adds changes and eliminates any unneccesary or excess code.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git checkout
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? git fetch brings updated data without copying it, git pull gets data and copies it, git merge allows you to merge the seperate branches together
7. What is a merge conflict? when git is unable to separate differences between two commits.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? open a file, see which lines are causing problems, and correct them.
